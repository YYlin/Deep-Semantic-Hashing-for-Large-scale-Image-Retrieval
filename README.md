# Deep-Semantic-Hashing-for-Large-scale-Image-Retrieval

The program is to combine both Transfer learning and average hash methods for unsupervised image retrieval. we employ a transfer learning strategy to learn image representation. And then the hash code is generated using the average hash algorithm from image representation.



### First, using pre-trained CNN model to generate features of the input images
	python main.py



#### use mean average precision (MAP) to Qualitative evaluation model
	python Calculation_MAP.py
